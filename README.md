# Quadcolor package for Python

This package is designed to produce text whose letters have
different-colored quadrants, as described
in the paper
[A Simple Method for Learning to Distinguish Mirror-Image Letters](https://edarxiv.org/m7a92/)
by James Bernhard. This type of text can be used to help people
learn to distinguish letters of the alphabet (usually lowercase
letters) from their mirror-image look-alikes.

Examples of text produced by this package can be found at
[letterreversals.org](https://letterreversals.org).

Instructions for how to use the package will be posted here soon.
